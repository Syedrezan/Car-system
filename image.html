		<h1> Toyota GT86 Engineering: </h1>
		<p>
			The 86's engine, known by the Toyota code 4U-GSE and Subaru code FA20, is a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine that uses Subaru's horizontally opposed boxer engine design, with the addition of Toyota's D-4S injection system, which uses both direct and port fuel injection. 
			Given its placement, the 86 can be considered having a front engine, rear wheel drive drivetrain layout. The engine runs on 98 RON (premium unleaded) fuel and features a 12.5:1 compression ratio and a bore and stroke of 86 mm (3.4 in) that results in 200 horsepower (149 kW; 
			203 PS) at 7,000 rpm and 151 lb·ft (205 N·m) of torque at 6,000 rpm.[23] As part of the 86's low-weight design, the car utilizes an aluminium hood,
			 a solid roof, and a trunk as opposed to a hatchback.[24][25] The boxer engine sits as far back and as low as possible in the engine bay for a weight distribution of 53% in front and 47% in the rear.</p>

		<h1>Design:</h1><br>
			<p>The 86 was designed around a front-mounted boxer engine, rear-wheel drive configuration, inspired by the AE86.
			The flat architecture of the boxer engine allows it to be mounted low, dropping the center of gravity down, resulting in sporty handling characteristics.[5] 
			The exterior design of the 86 delivers a slippery drag coefficient of Cd=0.27[27] and was inspired by the Toyota 2000GT's low-to-the-ground profile and long,
			sleek hood. Its design cues translate onto the 86 in such areas as: upward trailing edge of the doors; the upward finish to the side-window line; 
			the front and rear haunches; the circular taillights set in silver (singular instead of double as on the 2000GT).</P>
